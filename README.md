## What It Does

Give this plugin a Power Platform solution — a Copilot Studio agent directory, a solution ZIP, or a description — and it will:

1. **Analyze** all components: agents, topics, actions, flows, connectors, data entities, knowledge sources
2. **Generate** a self-contained, interactive HTML dashboard with:
   - Architecture diagrams and ERDs (pure inline SVG)
   - Clickable stat cards with detailed modal drawers
   - Data flow timelines with decision branches
   - Full component inventory with IDs and configurations
   - Architecture notes (strengths, risks, dependencies, ROI)
3. **Share** the dashboard via a 3-day PageDrop link, or open it locally

---

## Usage

### Invoke the Agent

In either Copilot CLI or Claude Code, just describe what you need:

- *"Analyze the HR Onboarding Assistant agent and generate an architecture dashboard"*
- *"Create an architecture diagram for this solution ZIP"*
- *"Review the architecture of my Power Platform solution"*

### Supported Inputs

| Input Type | How to Provide |
|---|---|
| Copilot Studio agent directory | Point to a folder with `.mcs.yml` files |
| Power Platform solution ZIP | Provide a path to a `.zip` export |
| Solution description | Describe your components in chat |

### Output

A single `{solution-name}-architecture.html` file with 5 interactive tabs:

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Layered component diagram with inline SVG |
| **ERD** | Entity Relationship Diagram with all data entities |
| **Data Flows** | Timeline visualization of data movement and decisions |
| **Components** | Categorized inventory cards with full details |
| **Notes** | Architecture strengths, considerations, dependencies |

After generation, you'll be asked to:
- **Share** via a 3-day PageDrop link (no signup required)
- **Open locally** in the default browser

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Orchestrator Agent** | Coordinates phased execution: arch-review → 5 parallel dashboard developers → post-review |
| **Arch-Review Agent** | Unpacks and catalogs every solution component, maps data flows, documents integrations |
| **Dashboard Developer Agent** | Generates the HTML dashboard — runs as 5 domain-focused instances co-developing one file |
| **Post-Review Agent** | Validates HTML structure, SVG correctness, component coverage, and stat card accuracy |
| **Dashboard Skill** | Full HTML/CSS/JS template with dark theme, inline SVG diagrams, modal drawers, responsive layout |
| **PageDrop Skill** | API reference for uploading HTML to shareable time-limited links |

---

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Copilot CLI** or **Claude Code** with plugin support
- **PowerShell** (for `Start-Process` and `Invoke-RestMethod`)
- **Internet access** for PageDrop API (optional, only for shareable links)

No API keys, tokens, or authentication required.

## Examples

### Copilot Studio Agent Analysis

```
User: Analyze the IT Help Desk Triage Agent and create an architecture dashboard

Agent: [Reads all .mcs.yml files → Maps 7 actions, 14 topics → Traces routing logic]
       [Generates triage-agent-architecture.html]

       Would you like a shareable link? (active for 3 days)
       > Yes

       🔗 Your architecture dashboard is live for 3 days:
       https://cool-forest-x2k4.pagedrop.io
```

### Power Platform Solution ZIP

```
User: Provide an architecture file for ExpenseApprovalWorkflow.zip

Agent: [Extracts ZIP → Analyzes entities, flows, relationships]
       [Generates expense-approval-workflow-architecture.html]

       Would you like a shareable link? (active for 3 days)
       > No — just open it locally

       📂 File saved to: C:\path\to\expense-approval-workflow-architecture.html
```

### Visual Walkthrough

Here's what the end-to-end flow looks like when analyzing a Power Platform solution ZIP:

**1. Agent analyzes the solution**

The agent extracts the ZIP, reads all solution components, and begins generating the architecture dashboard.

![Step 1 — Agent analyzes the solution ZIP](assets/Arch-1-Initialize.png)

**2. Choose how to share**

Once the dashboard is generated, you're prompted to share via a temporary PageDrop link or open it locally.

![Step 2 — Share options for the architecture dashboard](assets/Arch-2-Prompt.png)

**3. Dashboard ready**

The shareable link is live and the dashboard summary shows what's included — architecture diagrams, ERD, data flows, components, and notes.
